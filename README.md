# Web Design Challenge
Andrew Anastasiades | @andrew-ana  

## A couple of considerations...
1. Front-End work is incredibly tedious. I do not enjoy this.
2. I just got back from New Orleans and didn't have a bunch of time or focus to make this pretty. So it's not.

## The objective  
The assignment is to make a model dashboard to demonstrate HTML and Bootstrap.  

## A brief reflection  
I can definitely see the value of web-based dashboards. Unfortunately, my current work involves a lot of confidential patient and/or business information. I would love to implement something like this, but I worry that I would be exposing our data to breaches. In order for me to actually start working with the full stack development flow we are learning in class (DB->Flask->HTML/CSS) I would need to also use the user/authorization functionality. And at that point I'm just building an EHR and complexity spirals and explodes.
